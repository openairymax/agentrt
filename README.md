## Overview

**AgentRT** (full name **AirymaxAgentRT**) is the runtime layer of the Airymax
platform. It provides the mechanisms an agent team needs in order to run for a
long time on real hardware:

- a micro-kernel core with scheduling, syscalls and memory primitives,
- a three-stage cognitive loop (cognition → execution → memory),
- layered session and cross-session memory,
- a four-layer security dome that fails closed by default,
- an IPC and agent-to-agent protocol stack,
- a single gateway process that speaks HTTP / WebSocket / SSE / MCP / A2A /
  OpenAI and translates to JSON-RPC 2.0,
- a fleet of long-running daemons that orchestrate all of the above,
- a command-line interface and a terminal UI for interactive use.

Everything is written in C11 with language bindings for Python, Go, Rust and
TypeScript. The runtime is designed so that a single laptop and a multi-agent
deployment use exactly the same programming model.

This repository is the **release aggregate** for the runtime. The individual
components are maintained in their own repositories and are wired in as git
submodules, pinned to the exact commit that shipped with each release, so that
any published version can be reproduced commit for commit.

## Installation

### Linux and macOS

One command, no compilation required. The installer detects the platform,
downloads the matching prebuilt package, and verifies it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://atomgit.com/openairymax/agentrt/releases/download/latest/install.sh | bash
```

The script is shipped with each release. When the downloaded script is saved
to a file and executed from disk, the installer self-updates to the newest
version.

Note: pipe into `bash`, not `sh` — `sh` (dash) does not forward positional
arguments, so `--prefix`, `--channel` and similar flags would be silently
dropped.

### Windows

A native PowerShell installer is published for x86-64 and x86-32:

```powershell
irm https://atomgit.com/openairymax/agentrt/releases/download/latest/install.ps1 | iex
```

### npm

A thin wrapper package is published for Node.js users:

```bash
npm install -g @openairymax/agentrt
```

The package carries no install logic of its own: it locates an existing
install first, and otherwise delegates to the same `install.sh` /
`install.ps1` release assets above (Windows hand-off uses PowerShell).

### Options

Append flags after `| bash -s --` (or pass them directly when running the
script from a file):

```bash
# Custom install prefix (default: $HOME/.airymaxrt); first bootstrap only
... | bash -s -- --prefix "$HOME/.airymaxrt"

# Install from a release candidate instead of the stable channel
... | bash -s -- --channel rc

# Force a clean reinstall (clears the download cache, stops running daemons)
... | bash -s -- --reinstall

# Uninstall; add --keep-data to retain your memory data
... | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

`--prefix` is meaningful only for the **first bootstrap install**: at that
point there is no install root to infer from, so you must supply it. Once the
root is on disk (recorded in `<root>/config/install.env`), the launcher
resolves it on its own, so `airymaxrt update`, `airymaxrt uninstall` and
`--reinstall` all act on the installation they belong to — they neither need
nor should carry `--prefix`.

```bash
airymaxrt update            # updates the custom-path install in place
airymaxrt update --check    # check only, change nothing
```

Note: re-running `curl … | bash` after you are already installed is a **fresh
install**, not an update — without `--prefix` it falls back to the default
`$HOME/.airymaxrt` and leaves you with a second copy. To update an existing
install, use `airymaxrt update`. If several copies are present on one machine,
`which airymaxrt` shows which one your shell resolves.

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Architectures published |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Linux | x86-64, x86-32, arm-64 (aarch64), arm-32 (armv7l) |
| macOS | arm-64 (Apple Silicon), x86-64 |
| Windows | x86-64, x86-32 |

Packages are `.tar.gz` on Linux and macOS, `.zip` on Windows. Architectures not
listed above are not part of the prebuilt matrix; build them from source.

### First run

Start the runtime and its services by launching the terminal UI:

```bash
airymaxrt                 # terminal UI (falls back to the CLI on a dumb terminal)
airymaxrt cli             # force the plain command-line front end
airymaxrt status          # what is running right now
airymaxrt doctor          # component health check
airymaxrt logs 100        # last 100 lines of the runtime log
airymaxrt logs llm_d      # the log of one particular daemon
```

`airymaxrt profile` reports or overrides the hardware-derived runtime profile
(`full`, `minimal` or `auto`). The installer picks the profile for you, and
`airymaxrt monitor --daemon` keeps watching: if you add RAM or a GPU later, the
features that were trimmed are restored automatically. On Windows the same
commands are available through `airymaxrt`.

## Core capabilities

| Capability | What it gives you |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Chat and task modes** | A conversational mode for dialogue and a task mode for complex work, both driven by the CLI and the terminal UI. The same instruction automatically enters a plan-then-execute loop when the job is large. |
| **Multi-agent collaboration** | One lead agent orchestrates several child agents, splitting work in parallel and merging results back. Agents interoperate over a documented protocol. |
| **Planning and reflection** | Ambiguous goals are clarified interactively, then compiled into an executable task graph that is scheduled. Execution self-reflects and re-dispatches on failure. |
| **Persistent memory** | A built-in free memory backend with L1 session-level and L2 cross-session tiers, supporting retrieval and forgetting. Pluggable commercial backends are available. |
| **Tool loop** | The chat loop exposes real tools such as `web_search` and `web_fetch` to the model, feeds results back as tool messages, and renders the final answer as markdown. |
| **Security dome** | Four layers: sandbox isolation, RBAC authorisation, input/output sanitisation, audit logging. The default posture is fail-closed. |
| **Unified gateway** | `gateway_d` translates HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, MCP, A2A and OpenAI transports into one JSON-RPC 2.0 stream, so external systems have exactly one entry point. |
| **Fifteen runtime services** | Daemons for scheduling, agent execution, LLM bridging, tool dispatch, dual-think cognition, memory, marketplace, monitoring, notifications, channels, A2A, policy enforcement, maths and hooks — started in dependency order and self-healing. |
| **Observability** | A global event stream, a task board and health monitoring, surfaced by `airymaxrt status` and `airymaxrt doctor` and written to per-daemon log files. |

## Architecture

AgentRT is layered, and each layer depends only on the layers beneath it. The
SDK layer binds back to the support layer at the top of the stack, which is why
the dependency graph is drawn as a cycle.

```
SDK Layer        — CLI, terminal UI, Python / Go / Rust / TypeScript bindings
Service Layer    — 14 daemons that orchestrate the runtime        (daemons/)
Protocol Layer   — AgentsIPC and the A2A / A2T stacks             (protocols/)
Gateway Layer    — transports → JSON-RPC 2.0                      (gateway/)
Storage Layer    — heap-backed runtime persistence                (heapstore/)
Security Layer   — four-layer dome, policy decision and    (cupolas product)
                   enforcement points
Kernel Layer     — 5 atomic micro-kernel modules                  (atoms/)
Support Layer    — 32 cohesive utility modules + shared headers   (commons/)
```

- **Support layer (`commons`)** — the foundation every other layer builds on:
  logging, synchronisation, memory helpers, string handling, IPC helpers,
  configuration, observability, plus the authoritative type and error contracts.
- **Kernel layer (`atoms`)** — five atomic modules: `corekern` (init, lifecycle),
  `coreloopthree` (cognition → execution → memory loop), `syscall` (unified
  user/kernel-facing interface), `taskflow` (task graph and scheduling),
  `memory` (memory primitives and backends).
- **Security layer (`cupolas`)** — a policy decision point loads, distributes
  and rolls back policies; every daemon applies them locally through its own
  enforcement points, within seconds.
- **Storage layer (`heapstore`)** — persistence for runtime state, agent memory
  and transient data.
- **Gateway layer (`gateway`)** — protocol translation only, no business logic.
  It is the sole process boundary into the runtime.
- **Protocol layer (`protocols`)** — AgentsIPC with a fixed 128-byte message
  header for in-process and cross-process messaging, plus agent-to-agent (A2A)
  and agent-to-tool (A2T) stacks.
- **Service layer (`daemons`)** — the fourteen long-running processes that
  make the runtime an actual running system; the cupolas product ships its
  own `cupolas_d` policy shell on top (0.1.19 §255).
- **SDK layer** — lives in the sibling [`sdk/`](../sdk) tree and re-exports the
  layers below to application developers.

## Building from source

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| Operating system | Ubuntu 22.04+, macOS 13+, or Windows with MSVC |
| C compiler | GCC 11+ or Clang 14+ (C11) |
| Build tool | CMake 3.20+, Ninja (recommended) or Make |
| Libraries | SQLite3, cJSON, libyaml, libcurl, OpenSSL; libmicrohttpd and libwebsockets for the gateway |
| Optional | Rust (terminal UI), Python 3 (bundled script runtime) |

On Windows, dependencies are most easily obtained through
[vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):
`sqlite3 cjson libyaml curl openssl zlib libmicrohttpd libwebsockets libevent nghttp2`.

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone with all components
git clone --recursive https://atomgit.com/openairymax/agentrt.git
cd agentrt

# 2. Configure — the build directory must live outside the source tree
cmake -S . -B ../agentrt-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# 3. Build
cmake --build ../agentrt-build --parallel "$(nproc)"

# 4. Test
cd ../agentrt-build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

In-source builds are rejected: CMake raises a `FATAL_ERROR` if the build
directory is inside the source tree.

On Windows, add `-DBUILD_DAEMON=ON -DBUILD_CLI=ON` to the configure step if you
want the daemon fleet and the CLI; see the next section for why they are off by
default there.

### Key CMake options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `AIRY_BUILD_ALL` | `ON` | Build every AgentRT component |
| `BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Build unit tests and enable CTest |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `OFF` | Build shared libraries instead of static ones |
| `BUILD_ATOMS` / `BUILD_COMMONS` / `BUILD_CUPOLAS` / `BUILD_GATEWAY` / `BUILD_HEAPSTORE` | `ON` | Per-component build switches |
| `BUILD_DAEMON` | `ON` (POSIX), `OFF` (Windows) | Build the daemon fleet |
| `BUILD_CLI` | `ON` (POSIX), `OFF` (Windows) | Build the interactive CLI |
| `BUILD_TOOLKIT` | `OFF` | Build the language-SDK toolkit modules |
| `AIRY_MEMORY_BACKEND` | `builtin` | Memory backend: `builtin` or `memoryrovol` |
| `AIRY_WITH_MEMORYROVOL` | `ON` | Build against the commercial memory provider; falls back to the built-in backend when the provider source is absent |
| `AIRY_COMPLIANCE_STRICT` | `ON` | Strict compliance mode; poisons unsafe functions such as `strcpy` |
| `ENABLE_SANITIZERS` | `OFF` | ASan + LSan + UBSan; enable explicitly when diagnosing memory bugs |
| `ENABLE_TSAN` | `OFF` | ThreadSanitizer; mutually exclusive with the above |
| `ENABLE_COVERAGE` | `OFF` | Code-coverage instrumentation |
| `WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` | `OFF` | Treat compiler warnings as errors |

Released packages are built with sanitizers off. Turning `ENABLE_SANITIZERS` on
is a debugging aid, not a deployment setting.

## Releases and channels

- **Stable** is the default channel and the one the installer uses.
- **rc** carries release candidates for preview; interfaces may still change.
- **beta** is occasionally opened for targeted testing.

```bash
airymaxrt update              # move to the newest build on your channel
airymaxrt update --check      # report without changing anything
airymaxrt update --channel rc # switch channel
airymaxrt update --rollback   # return to the previously installed version
```

Each version ships with a GPG-signed manifest in [`latest/`](latest), which is
what the updater reads. [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) records the release
history.

The current release is **v0.1.18**. Highlights:

- The scheduler policy engine was rebuilt as a table-driven design, dropping
  more than 1,400 lines of stale policy branches; the scheduling path is now
  shorter and its behaviour easier to reason about.
- The model-service daemon (`llm_d`) completed its service-face template
  conversion: its service surface now matches every other daemon, so upgrades
  behave more predictably.
- Five chunks of consumer-less legacy code were removed (old scheduler policy,
  a leftover monitoring branch, a general-purpose cache compatibility layer, a
  tool-service adapter bridge and an orphaned test file), leaving the install
  package and runtime leaner.
- Four new automated release gates (module-size ceiling, link closure, header
  shadowing and propagation dead-signal) now block regressions before a
  release ships.
- Daemons no longer link service libraries implicitly; every cross-service call
  goes through the system bus, lowering coupling risk on upgrade.
